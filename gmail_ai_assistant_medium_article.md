## 🚀 The Workflow Implementation

### Step 1: User Authentication & Session Management 🔑

```python
# Supabase-powered authentication system
def sign_in(email, password):
    response = supabase_client.auth.sign_in_with_password({
        "email": email,
        "password": password
    })
    if response and response.user:
        st.session_state.authenticated = True
        st.session_state.user = response.user
        st.session_state.thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
```

**Key Advantages:**
- 🔒 Secure user sessions with JWT tokens
- 🔄 Persistent conversation threads across sessions
- 👤 User isolation with unique thread IDs
- 🚪 Seamless logout/login experience

### Step 2: LangGraph Agent Orchestration 🤖

```python
async def run_agent_interaction(user_input: str, user_email: str, thread_id: str):
    config = {
        "configurable": {
            "thread_id": thread_id,
            "user_id": user_email
        },
        "recursion_limit": 100
    }
    
    async with (
        AsyncPostgresStore.from_conn_string(database_url) as store,
        AsyncPostgresSaver.from_conn_string(database_url) as checkpointer,
    ):
        graph = build_graph()
        response = await stream_agent_response(user_input, graph, config, response_placeholder)
```

**What Makes This Special:**
- 🧠 Persistent memory using PostgreSQL checkpointing
- 🔄 Async processing for better performance
- 📊 State management across complex multi-step operations
- 🎯 Context awareness from previous conversations

### Step 3: Real-Time Streaming Response System ⚡

```python
class StreamlitWriter:
    def __init__(self, placeholder):
        self.placeholder = placeholder
        self.content = ""
    
    def __call__(self, text):
        # Smart formatting for different content types
        if "🔐 Authorization required" in text:
            if not self.content.endswith("\n"):
                self.content += "\n"
            self.content += text + "\n"
        
        self.placeholder.markdown(self.content)
```

**Real-Time Features:**
- 📺 Live content streaming as the agent processes
- 🎨 Smart formatting for different content types
- 🚫 Duplicate prevention with content hashing
- 📧 Email-specific formatting for better readability

### Step 4: Advanced Email Content Processing 📧

```python
def _format_json_email_data(data):
    """Format JSON email data in simple list format."""
    if 'emails' in data and isinstance(data['emails'], list):
        formatted_content += f"**Here are the emails from {data.get('from', 'your inbox')}:**\n\n"
        
        for i, email in enumerate(data['emails'], 1):
            subject = email.get('subject', 'No subject')
            from_name = email.get('from_name', email.get('from', 'Unknown'))
            from_email = email.get('from_email', email.get('from', 'unknown@example.com'))
            
            formatted_content += f"{i}. Subject: \"{subject}\" from {from_name} ({from_email})\n"
            
            # Include full email body content
            if 'body' in email and email['body']:
                body = email['body']
                if len(body) > 500:
                    body = body[:500] + "...\n[Content truncated - full email content available]"
                formatted_content += f"   Content: {body}\n\n"
```

**Content Processing Features:**
- 📝 Full email content display (not just snippets)
- 🔍 Smart duplicate detection across sessions
- 🎨 Clean formatting for better readability
- ⚡ Performance optimization with content truncation
